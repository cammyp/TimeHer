# Description

I wanted visual elements on the screen that matched the time on the timer. This was the first challange that I solved using a ForEach loop with a reversed range from 0 to the timeRemaining. After that I created a ridiculously long if else if else statement that correctly layed out my views on the screen. If I has an extra day I would definitely we work how I programmed this. When the timer is finished a custom spritekit particle is displayed. 

Things I could have added:
Sound feedback when the timer is finished
Vibrations when the timer is finished
Pop up error message if a time greater than 3600 was set on the timer
