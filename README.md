# Description

I wanted visual elements on the screen that matched the time on the timer. This was the first challange that I solved using a ForEach loop with a reversed range from 0 to the timeRemaining. 

After that I created a ridiculously long if else if else statement that correctly layed out my views on the screen. If I has an extra day I would definitely we work how I programmed this. When the timer is finished a custom spritekit particle is displayed. 



# Things I could have added

- Sound feedback when the timer is finished
- Vibrations when the timer is finished
- Pop up error message if a time greater than 3600 was set on the timer
